This is a project with two python files.

"cryptography.py" creates a unique key whenever it is run and uses the key to encrypt and decrypt a string

"encoder.py" creates a tkinter window where you can input a string to be encoded by rot13 or another rot cypher.

More files may be added in the future. Thanks for checking my project out!
